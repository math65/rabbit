Usage: build-bundle.sh --binary <path> --version <x.y.z> --out <dir> --zip-name <name.zip>
  --binary     Path to the built rabbit Mach-O executable.
  --version    Version string to embed in CFBundleVersion / CFBundleShortVersionString.
  --out        Output directory; will be created if missing. Both Rabbit.app and the zip land here.
  --zip-name   Filename for the zipped bundle (e.g. rabbit-0.1.0-macos-aarch64.app.zip).
  --adhoc-sign Optionally ad-hoc sign the bundle (codesign -s -). Off by default.
