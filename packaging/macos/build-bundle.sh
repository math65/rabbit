usage() {
	cat >&2 <<'USAGE'
Usage: build-bundle.sh --binary <path> --version <x.y.z> --out <dir> --zip-name <name.zip> [signing flags]
  --binary         Path to the built rabbit Mach-O executable.
  --version        Version string to embed in CFBundleVersion / CFBundleShortVersionString.
  --out            Output directory; will be created if missing. Both Rabbit.app and the zip land here.
  --zip-name       Filename for the zipped bundle (e.g. rabbit-0.1.0-macos-universal.app.zip).

Signing (pick at most one of --sign / --adhoc-sign):
  --sign <identity>   Developer ID sign with the given codesign identity, e.g.
                      "Developer ID Application: Name (TEAMID)". Signs the inner
                      binary and the bundle with the hardened runtime + a secure
                      timestamp (both required for notarization).
  --adhoc-sign        Ad-hoc sign (codesign -s -). Doesn't satisfy Gatekeeper for
                      distribution; ships the "Open Me First.command" helper.

Notarization (requires --sign):
  --notarize             Submit the signed bundle to Apple's notary service and
                         staple the resulting ticket. Ships Rabbit.app with no helper.
  --notary-key <path>    App Store Connect API key (.p8) for notarytool.
  --notary-key-id <id>   App Store Connect API Key ID.
  --notary-issuer <id>   App Store Connect API Issuer ID.

macOS likely showed a security warning instead of launching Rabbit.
That's expected for unsigned apps on macOS 15 and later. To approve:

  1. Dismiss the security warning (click "Done").
  2. In the Settings window we just opened, scroll to the "Security"
     section near the bottom of Privacy & Security.
  3. Click "Open Anyway" next to the Rabbit entry.
  4. Confirm with your password or Touch ID if asked. Rabbit.app
     will launch.

This approval is per-app, not per-launch — once you've clicked
"Open Anyway", future double-clicks on Rabbit.app work normally.
RABBIT's self-update replaces the binary in place under the same bundle
identity, so updates inherit the approval; only a fresh download into a
different location triggers the dance again.
