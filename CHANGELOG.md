# Changelog

All notable changes to RABBIT are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## How to update

Add entries under `## [Unreleased]` as part of each change. Use these
subsection headings (omit any that are empty):

- `### Added` — new features
- `### Changed` — changes to existing behavior
- `### Deprecated` — soon-to-be-removed features
- `### Removed` — now-removed features
- `### Fixed` — bug fixes
- `### Security` — security fixes

To cut a release, run the **prepare-release** workflow from the GitHub
Actions tab (workflow_dispatch) with the version `X.Y.Z` as input. It will:

1. Validate that `[Unreleased]` is non-empty and the tag is unused.
2. Bump the workspace `version` in `Cargo.toml` (and refresh `Cargo.lock`).
3. Insert `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` below `## [Unreleased]`, leaving a
   fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` on top.
4. Commit, tag `vX.Y.Z`, push both, and dispatch the release workflow.

The release workflow then extracts the section matching the tag's version
from this file and posts it as the GitHub release body.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Installations are faster: package downloads now run in parallel (up to
  three at a time), and each package installs as soon as its own download
  finishes instead of waiting for every download to complete. In a typical
  setup, REAPER, OSARA, and SWS are already installed while FFmpeg's large
  archive is still downloading. Installs themselves still run one at a
  time and in the usual order, so nothing changes about elevation prompts
  or the order packages land on disk. The progress page now tracks several
  simultaneous downloads: the bar combines their progress, and the status
  line summarizes them ("Downloading 3 packages…") while an install is not
  running. If something fails partway through, packages that already
  installed keep their receipts, so RABBIT still knows about them
  afterwards.

### Fixed

- Large downloads no longer fail on slow or briefly stalling servers.
  Package downloads (and RABBIT's own self-update download) previously
  inherited a 30-second network timeout, so a download whose connection
  stalled for longer — routine for FFmpeg's ~390 MB archive from the busy
  gyan.dev server — was aborted with a cryptic "I/O error … error decoding
  response body" and took the whole installation with it. Downloads now
  tolerate stalls of up to a minute, and an interrupted connection is
  retried up to three times, resuming from the bytes already received when
  the server supports it (verified so a resumed file can never mix two
  different upstream versions) instead of starting over. If the connection
  keeps dropping, the error now clearly names the download URL and suggests
  checking the internet connection, rather than pointing at a temp file on
  disk.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **app2clap** (Windows only) — install and update support for jcsteh's
  app2clap, a CLAP plug-in that captures audio from other applications into
  REAPER (or any CLAP host). RABBIT tracks the rolling GitHub `snapshots`
  release, picks the highest-versioned build, and installs `app2clap.clap`
  into the per-user CLAP folder (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Common\CLAP`), so no
  administrator rights are needed. It appears under the new **Additional
  software** group. Updates replace the existing copy (backing up the old one
  first); a copy installed for a different REAPER target or by hand is detected
  by file presence, with the version reported as unknown until RABBIT installs
  it itself. Like Surge XT, it's disabled on portable REAPER targets — the CLAP
  folder lives outside any portable REAPER folder.
- French (fr-FR) UI translation. RABBIT now ships with English, German, and
  French out of the box; the language picker lists Français (France) and the
  OS-language auto-detection on first launch covers French locales (including
  regional variants such as fr-CA, which map to fr-FR).
- Italian (it-IT) UI translation. The language picker now lists Italiano
  (Italia), it ships in the macOS app bundle, and OS-language auto-detection on
  first launch covers Italian locales (any `it-*`, which map to it-IT).
- The wizard's primary action is now the window's default button, so pressing
  Enter activates it from anywhere in the page (Next on the navigation steps,
  Install on the review step) instead of only when a button already holds
  focus. This matches the standard dialog convention on both macOS and Windows.
  A disabled default button stays a no-op, so an invalid Target step or a
  review step that can't install yet won't advance.

### Changed

- The wizard's package list now groups packages into an **Additional
  software** section, separate from the main **Packages** list, for extras
  that aren't part of REAPER itself. **Surge XT** moves into this new group
  (and future additional software like app2clap will land there too). Each
  group has its own check-all header and aggregate state; the main Packages
  group is unaffected. The new group is localized in all four UI languages
  and only appears when at least one additional package is available for the
  selected target.
- REAPER updates no longer leave an unwanted desktop icon on Windows.
  REAPER's silent installer always (re)creates a desktop shortcut, with no
  switch to suppress it, so updating a REAPER whose icon you'd deleted put it
  back. RABBIT now snapshots the desktop shortcuts before running the
  installer and, once the install is confirmed, removes a REAPER shortcut the
  installer freshly created — unless this is a brand-new standard install (the
  one case a new icon is wanted) or an icon was already there (never touched).
  Portable installs already create no shortcut, so this is a no-op for them.
  Windows only; checks both the per-user and the all-users desktop, and only
  removes a `REAPER*.lnk` that appeared during the install.
- A single unreachable upstream no longer blocks the entire update check.
  Previously, when one latest-version provider failed (e.g. the SWS homepage
  being down), the wizard stopped on the version-check page and the CLI's
  `latest` / `plan --online` commands aborted — even though every other
  package could still be checked and updated. Now the check always completes
  with whatever providers answered: in the wizard, each failed package's row
  is disabled (unchecked, with a localized "online version check failed"
  indicator) and a note with the full error appears in the review summary,
  while all other packages keep their normal install/update flow. On the
  CLI, `latest` prints resolved versions to stdout and per-package warnings
  to stderr, and `plan --online` records each failure as a plan note. The
  `latest --json` output shape changed accordingly: it is now an object with
  `packages` and `failures` arrays instead of a bare array.

### Fixed

- A blocked plugin overwrite on macOS now explains how to fix it instead of
  showing a bare "OS error 1". That error is EPERM ("operation not
  permitted") and is *not* REAPER being open (that would be a different error
  — RABBIT already handles it), so closing REAPER doesn't help; it's a macOS
  permission/modification gate (App Management on Sonoma and later, an
  immutable file flag, or ownership). When replacing an installed extension
  such as `reaper_kontrol.dylib` fails with EPERM/EACCES, RABBIT now reports
  that it's a permission block and points the user to grant RABBIT Full Disk
  Access (or App Management) under System Settings → Privacy & Security, then
  quit and relaunch — rather than leaving them with an opaque error.
  Additionally, a new macOS preflight check catches this *before* downloading
  and installing: it rehearses the write into the `UserPlugins` folder
  (creating and deleting a probe file, and renaming each already-installed
  `reaper_*` plugin aside and back — non-destructively, the files are left
  exactly as they were) and fails up front with the same guidance if the OS
  denies it. macOS only; other failures and platforms are unchanged.
- The "close REAPER before installing" preflight no longer fails open when
  REAPER's process is running but its executable path can't be read. On
  Windows that happens routinely — most often when REAPER is running elevated
  while RABBIT is not (the OS denies the image-path query), or under some
  antivirus — and RABBIT would detect the `reaper.exe` process by name but,
  unable to match its (unknown) path to the install target, silently treat it
  as a *different* REAPER and let the installer overwrite a running one. The
  check is now fail-safe: a running REAPER whose path we can't read is treated
  as the target and blocks the install (or warns, with the override on), so
  the user is told to close REAPER instead of getting a corrupted update. A
  REAPER with a readable, non-matching path is still correctly ignored.
- Setup no longer fails with "stream did not contain valid UTF-8" when
  `reapack.ini` isn't UTF-8-encoded. ReaPack writes its config through the
  Win32 profile-string APIs, which use the active ANSI code page (or UTF-16
  when the file carries a BOM), so a repository name with a single non-ASCII
  character — e.g. a CP-1252 curly apostrophe — made RABBIT's strict UTF-8
  read error out and abort the run's post-install configuration step, right
  after all packages had installed successfully. RABBIT now decodes such
  files losslessly (UTF-8, UTF-16 LE/BE with BOM, or byte-preserving ANSI),
  edits them, and writes them back in their original encoding, so existing
  bytes survive untouched and ReaPack still parses the file. The same
  encoding-tolerant handling now covers `reaper-kb.ini` during OSARA key-map
  replacement, whose script names can carry ANSI bytes too. Reported in
  issue #7.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- The wizard now auto-detects a portable REAPER sitting in RABBIT's own
  folder. If you drop `rabbit` next to a portable REAPER (reaper.exe +
  reaper.ini on Windows, a `REAPER*.app` bundle on macOS), that install is
  discovered as a target and selected by default — so you can check for
  updates straight away without going through the Browse button.

### Changed

- macOS builds are now signed with an Apple Developer ID and notarized by
  Apple (then stapled) when the release's `MACOS_*` signing secrets are
  configured. Gatekeeper trusts a notarized bundle on first launch, so the
  download is just "unzip and double-click `Rabbit.app`" — the
  `Open Me First.command` quarantine helper is gone from signed builds. Forks
  and credential-less builds still fall back to ad-hoc signing with the
  helper. A new manual `macos-signing-smoke` workflow exercises and verifies
  the full sign → notarize → staple path so it can be validated before a
  release tag.

### Fixed

- Elevated NSIS installers now receive their `/D=<path>` install-directory
  flag correctly, so packages whose vendor installer is NSIS land in the
  REAPER folder RABBIT planned instead of NSIS's default
  `C:\Program Files\REAPER (x64)\`. `quote_one` was doubling every
  backslash and wrapping the flag in double quotes, but NSIS reads `/D=`
  straight from `GetCommandLine()` and takes everything after it verbatim
  to end-of-string — so the quoted path arrived with a trailing `"` baked
  into the directory name (an invalid path). NSIS fell back to its default
  location, and post-install verification at the planned path then
  surfaced the installer's `1223` exit code as a hard error, leaving every
  package after REAPER unprocessed. `/D=…` arguments are now passed
  unquoted and last as NSIS requires, and backslash escaping follows the
  Windows command-line spec (only backslashes immediately before a `"` are
  doubled). Windows only. Fixed in PR #6 by @trypsynth.
- Self-update apply on macOS no longer leaves the swapped binary
  non-executable. The staged source is the bare universal Mach-O off
  the GitHub release, and HTTPS downloads strip Unix mode bits, so
  `fs::copy` propagated a 0o644 mode onto `Rabbit.app/Contents/MacOS/rabbit`.
  Finder then labelled the file "document" instead of "Unix executable"
  and the bundle refused to launch — even though `codesign --force --deep`
  succeeded on it. `swap_install_file` now re-asserts 0o755 on the
  install target right after the copy, before the bundle re-sign step.
  No-op on Windows. Reported in issue #5.
- Self-update apply in the GUI now exits the old RABBIT process after
  spawning the relaunched copy. Previously the swap completed and the
  new version launched, but the pre-update window kept running next to
  it because the apply callback never asked the wx event loop to shut
  down. The relaunch path now mirrors the language-switch relaunch and
  calls `std::process::exit(0)` once the new process has been spawned;
  the error path is unchanged so a failed spawn still leaves the
  original window open. CLI `apply --restart` was already correct.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- New package: **Surge XT**, the free open-source hybrid synthesizer from
  the [Surge Synth Team](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/). Opt-in,
  Windows + macOS, standard REAPER installations only. RABBIT runs the
  vendor installer (Inno Setup on Windows, productbuild-wrapped `.pkg`
  on macOS) under elevation so the VST3, CLAP, AU (macOS) and standalone
  formats land system-wide for REAPER and other DAWs to pick up. Tracks
  the rolling nightly channel at
  `surge-synthesizer/surge` releases tag `Nightly` rather than the
  stable 1.3.4 release (2024-08-11) — the project effectively ships
  through nightlies now. Version detection layers a `NIGHTLY-<date>-<sha>`
  token from the receipt over a Medium-confidence semver fallback read
  from the vendor-installed VST3 bundle's file metadata.
- macOS elevation primitive in `rabbit-platform::elevation`: wraps the
  elevated command in `osascript -e 'do shell script "…" with
  administrator privileges'` so the system raises its native
  AuthorizationServices dialog. First (and currently only) consumer is
  the Surge XT `MountDiskImageAndRunPkgInstaller` runner.
- New `PlannedExecutionKind::MountDiskImageAndRunPkgInstaller` runner:
  mounts a `.dmg`, locates the inner `.pkg` via a filename-suffix glob
  matched against the mounted volume root, invokes `/usr/sbin/installer
  -pkg <path> -target /` under admin authorization, and detaches the
  image whether the install succeeded or failed.

- Automatic ReaPack script-action preservation across OSARA key-map
  replacement. Replacing `reaper-kb.ini` with `OSARA.ReaperKeyMap` —
  the default OSARA-recommended flow — drops every `SCR` line ReaPack
  had registered through REAPER's `AddRemoveReaScript` API, so installed
  ReaScripts disappear from REAPER's actions list until the user runs
  "ReaPack: Synchronize packages" inside REAPER (or re-installs every
  package). The unattended replacement path now reads the existing
  `reaper-kb.ini` first, captures all of its `SCR` records, lets the
  OSARA key map overwrite the file as before, then re-appends the
  preserved lines using the written file's newline convention. Any
  user `KEY` binding that targeted one of those scripts keeps working —
  REAPER derives the `_RS<hex>` action command ID deterministically
  from the script path, so the re-appended SCR lines bind to the same
  IDs the user already has in their key map. No opt-out: the
  preservation always runs when the OSARA key map is replaced.

- Live per-package progress reporting on the wizard's Installation
  progress page. The previous progress page set the gauge to 10 % when
  install kicked off, then jumped straight to 100 % at the end —
  everything in between was a black box even though packages like
  REAPER's macOS dmg take ~30 MB of network transfer per install.
  The setup pipeline now emits structured `ProgressEvent`s
  (`DownloadStarted` / `DownloadProgress` / `DownloadCompleted` /
  `InstallStarted` / `InstallCompleted` / `ConfigurationStarted` /
  `ConfigurationCompleted`) through an optional `ProgressReporter`
  threaded down from `execute_setup_operation_with_progress` into
  `download_artifacts_with_progress` and
  `install_cached_artifacts_with_progress`. The artifact downloader
  swapped `std::io::copy` for a chunked read/write loop that emits a
  byte-progress event every ~256 KiB or ~200 ms (whichever is rarer),
  so the gauge moves smoothly during the REAPER dmg pull instead of
  stalling. The wxdragon wizard forwards each event to the UI thread
  via `wxdragon::call_after`: the gauge advances by a per-phase
  fraction (weighted by completed downloads/installs plus the
  in-flight byte fraction), the status label updates to "Downloading
  REAPER… 12.4 MB / 30.0 MB", and a running log of completed
  transitions appends to the progress details TextCtrl (screen
  readers announce each new line as it lands). The no-progress
  entry points (`execute_setup_operation`,
  `execute_resolved_setup_operation`, `download_artifacts`,
  `install_cached_artifacts`, `execute_wizard_install`) stay on
  their existing signatures and delegate via `ProgressReporter::noop`,
  so the CLI and existing tests are unaffected.

### Fixed

- Wizard startup detection no longer SHA-256-hashes every receipted
  install file. `verify_package_receipt` used to verify each entry in
  a package's receipt by hashing the on-disk file, which on Windows
  meant 14 seconds of stalled UI just for FFmpeg (~200 MB of DLLs)
  and ~1 second for REAPER on every wizard launch — plus another
  round of the same after every install via the post-install rescan
  hook. The receipt verifier now checks file existence and size only;
  size mismatch alone catches every realistic regression the detection
  layer cares about (partial overwrites, truncated files), and the
  receipt's own stamped version is what gets shown either way.
  Recording hashes during install is unchanged.

- FFmpeg version detection no longer freezes the wizard for tens of
  seconds on Windows when an FFmpeg install is present. Probe 2
  previously called `ffmpeg.exe -version` via `std::process::Command`
  on the UI thread, which on Windows blocks for the entire AV scan of
  FFmpeg's dozens of DLL dependencies — easily 20-30 s per launch on
  a default-configured machine, and the same stall ran on the
  post-install rescan after installing FFmpeg too. Probe 2 now scans
  the `ffmpeg.exe` binary for the contiguous `show_banner` format
  string anchored on the unique `the FFmpeg developers` literal, and
  pulls `<VERSION>` out between the trailing `version ` token and the
  next `Copyright` marker. That matches both the upstream FFmpeg
  banner (`%s version <VERSION>, Copyright (c) …`) and the Gyan.dev
  full-builds variant that drops the comma and pads with spaces
  (`%s version 8.1.1-full_build-www.gyan.dev         Copyright (c) …`),
  so externally-installed Gyan FFmpegs now report `8.1.1` instead of
  the libavformat-major fallback's `8.0.0`. Same `High` confidence as
  before; the matching detector id changed from `ffmpeg-cli-version`
  to `ffmpeg-binary-version-string`.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-13

### Changed

- Self-update is now a modal Yes/No prompt at startup instead of a
  button on the wizard's Done page. The previous design was effectively
  unreachable: users had to finish an install before they ever saw the
  "Apply RABBIT update" button, and the always-visible status bar line
  pointed at a button most users couldn't find. The startup self-update
  check now raises a Yes/No dialog as soon as it completes; "Yes" runs
  the apply inline (with progress in the status bar) and relaunches
  RABBIT, "No" dismisses the prompt for the rest of the session. Users
  who change their mind can relaunch RABBIT to be re-prompted; the
  status-bar line spells that out.

### Fixed

- Per-arch artifact dispatch on a fresh first-time install. On macOS
  with no existing `/Applications/REAPER.app`, the binary-header probe
  in `standard_macos_installation` couldn't read a file that wasn't
  there yet and returned `Architecture::Unknown`. The SWS and ReaPack
  resolvers then fell through to their `Unknown → X64` fallback arms
  and downloaded `sws-…-Darwin-x86_64.dmg` and
  `reaper_reapack-x86_64.dylib`, even on Apple Silicon hosts running
  natively where the freshly-installed REAPER would launch as `arm64`
  and refuse to load the mismatched extension binaries. The dispatch-
  time canonicalizer (renamed from `canonicalize_macos_universal_arch`
  to `canonicalize_dispatch_arch`) now collapses `Unknown` to the host
  slice the same way it collapses `Universal` — `Architecture::current()`
  with Rosetta correction — so the upcoming install lands arch-correct
  plug-ins regardless of whether REAPER was already on disk when the
  wizard launched. The fix also closes the equivalent x64-fallback bug
  on Windows-on-ARM, where an unprobed target would have produced
  `Windows-x64.exe` SWS and `reaper_reapack-x64.dll` instead of the
  arm64ec variants.

- macOS Rosetta detection. v0.1.1 shelled out to `/usr/sbin/sysctl -n
  sysctl.proc_translated` to determine whether RABBIT was running
  under Rosetta, but `sysctl.proc_translated` reports the *querying*
  process's translation state — and the shelled-out `sysctl` binary
  always runs as the host's native arch (the kernel picks its native
  slice at exec time, ignoring the parent's translation state). The
  probe therefore always reported `false`, including when RABBIT
  itself was the translated `x86_64` slice on Apple Silicon. The
  artifact dispatcher then canonicalized REAPER-Universal to
  `Architecture::current()` (i.e., `X64`) and installed `x86_64`
  plug-ins against an `arm64`-native REAPER process. The probe now
  calls `sysctlbyname` directly via FFI from RABBIT's own process, so
  the kernel resolves the key against RABBIT's translation state.

- macOS self-update used to leave `Rabbit.app` structurally invalid
  after the binary swap. The release pipeline now ad-hoc signs the
  bare `rabbit-<version>-macos-universal` artifact itself (so the
  staged-in binary has a valid embedded signature even though
  `lipo -create` strips its inputs' sigs), and `apply_self_update`
  re-seals the enclosing `.app` bundle with `codesign --force --deep
  --sign -` after the swap. Both pieces are needed: the bare-binary
  signing keeps Apple Silicon's exec checks happy and the bundle
  re-seal restores the `_CodeSignature/CodeResources` consistency that
  Gatekeeper checks on Finder launch. Without these, post-update
  Finder launches on macOS 15 (Sequoia) and 26 (Tahoe) would refuse
  the bundle as corrupt rather than just untrusted.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- Stable always-latest download URLs for every platform, e.g.
  `https://github.com/Timtam/rabbit/releases/latest/download/rabbit-windows-x86_64.exe`
  and `…/rabbit-macos-universal.app.zip`. The release pipeline now
  publishes version-less aliases of each artifact alongside the
  versioned originals, so the URLs above resolve to whatever release is
  current at the time of the click. The README's Download section has
  been switched to direct links; the GitHub Releases page is still
  there for users who want to pin a version or verify SHA-256 sums.

### Changed

- macOS: ship a single universal Mach-O instead of separate Apple Silicon
  and Intel builds. The release pipeline now builds both arches and
  `lipo -create`s them into one binary, published as
  `rabbit-<version>-macos-universal` (and `…-universal.app.zip`). The
  self-update manifest's `platforms` map keeps its `macos-aarch64` and
  `macos-x86_64` keys for backward compatibility with already-released
  RABBIT 0.1.0 clients, both pointing at the universal artifact, so
  existing installs migrate to the fat binary on their next self-update
  check without a manual download.

### Fixed

- macOS: `Cmd+C` (and `Cmd+S` in the German build) no longer closes the
  wizard. Wizard buttons used `&Close` / `&Schließen`-style mnemonics
  for Alt-key access on Windows and Linux, but wxWidgets' OSX backend
  binds those `&` mnemonics as `Cmd+letter` accelerators — colliding
  with macOS system shortcuts (Cmd+C copy, Cmd+S save, …). Mnemonics
  on buttons aren't HIG-conformant on macOS anyway, so they're now
  stripped from the label entirely on that platform; underlined
  Alt-key access continues to work on Windows and Linux.

- macOS first-launch helper: `Open Me First.command` no longer falsely
  reports success on macOS 15 (Sequoia) and 26 (Tahoe). Removing the
  `com.apple.quarantine` xattr is no longer enough on those versions —
  Gatekeeper blocks unsigned bundles on first launch regardless of
  quarantine state. The helper now (a) verifies the xattr was actually
  cleared *recursively* across the bundle (the previous version checked
  only the bundle root, missing inner-file failures), (b) detects the
  macOS version, and (c) on macOS 15+ triggers a launch attempt to
  register Rabbit.app with Gatekeeper, then deep-links System Settings
  → Privacy & Security so the user's "Open Anyway" approval is one
  click away. macOS 14 and earlier keep the original quiet behavior.

- macOS: install no longer aborts with
  `no artifact found for sws on MacOs/Universal` (and the analogous
  silent ReaPack-arm64 mis-install on Intel hosts) when REAPER is a
  universal Mach-O. The artifact dispatcher now canonicalizes
  `Architecture::Universal` to the host slice on macOS before
  per-package resolvers run, so SWS picks the matching `Darwin-x86_64`
  / `Darwin-arm64` `.dmg` and ReaPack picks the matching
  `reaper_reapack-x86_64.dylib` / `reaper_reapack-arm64.dylib`. On
  Apple Silicon Macs running RABBIT under Rosetta, the dispatcher
  consults `sysctl.proc_translated` and forces the `arm64` slice so
  plug-ins match the `arm64`-native REAPER process rather than the
  `x86_64` translator's view.

- macOS: VoiceOver now reads the German UI with a German voice. The
  bundle previously declared only English (`CFBundleDevelopmentRegion`
  with no `CFBundleLocalizations` and no `.lproj` directories), so
  Cocoa picked the English voice for every accessibility string
  regardless of the in-app language. The bundle now ships
  `CFBundleLocalizations` for `en` and `de`, matching empty
  `en.lproj` / `de.lproj` stubs, and seats `AppleLanguages` from the
  resolved runtime locale before wxDragon brings up Cocoa so the
  override also takes effect for users on an English-language macOS
  who switch RABBIT to German.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-09

Initial public release. RABBIT is a REAPER accessibility bootstrap and
bundle installer with a screen-reader-friendly GUI wizard and a matching
CLI, packaged as a single self-contained executable per platform.

### Added

- **Accessibility-first wizard** built on wxDragon: keyboard-first
  navigation, native controls, tested with NVDA, JAWS, Narrator, and
  VoiceOver. Wizard runs when launched without arguments; arguments hand
  off to the CLI.
- **Cross-platform builds**: Windows x86_64, Windows aarch64, macOS
  aarch64, and macOS x86_64. macOS ships as an ad-hoc-signed `.app.zip`
  with an `Open Me First.command` helper that clears Gatekeeper
  quarantine on first launch.
- **Localization**: English (en-US) and German (de-DE) bundled, with
  Fluent-based runtime locale selection. Auto-picks the OS language when
  a translation is available.
- **REAPER discovery**: detects standard installations on Windows and
  macOS, plus user-supplied portable folders. Reports app path, resource
  path, version, architecture, writability, and confidence.
- **Package install / update** for REAPER, OSARA, SWS, ReaPack,
  ReaKontrol, JAWS-for-REAPER scripts (Windows + JAWS only), and FFmpeg
  shared runtime (Windows, opt-in; pulled from gyan.dev on x64 and
  tordona/ffmpeg-win-arm64 on ARM64, pinned to FFmpeg 8.x).
- **Architecture-aware artifact resolution**: selects x86_64 / aarch64 /
  arm64ec / universal builds appropriate to the detected REAPER, with
  per-arch self-update assets in the release manifest.
- **Configuration steps**: post-install tweaks managed alongside package
  installs. Ships with `reapack-add-reaper-accessibility-remote`, which
  adds the REAPER Accessibility ReaPack repository
  (`Timtam/reapack`) and is idempotent on re-runs.
- **Preflight checks** that run before any apply: REAPER process state,
  resource path writability, donation acknowledgement for ReaPack, etc.
  CLI returns a non-zero exit when checks fail.
- **Dry-run by default in the CLI**: every install / update / restore
  command requires `--apply` to make changes. JSON output available on
  every command via `--json`.
- **Backups and rollback**: each install writes a backup set under
  `<resource>/RABBIT/backups/<timestamp>/`; `rabbit backups` lists them
  and `rabbit restore-backup` rolls one back.
- **JSON + text reports** under `<resource>/RABBIT/logs/` for every
  install, update, restore, and setup operation.
- **Self-update**: signed update manifest published alongside each
  GitHub release with per-arch URLs and SHA-256 sums; `rabbit
  self-update check / stage / apply [--restart]` (CLI) and an automatic
  on-startup check (GUI). Handles bare-binary replacement on Windows and
  macOS without the user re-clearing Gatekeeper.
- **Portable runtime**: the binary carries embedded resources (locales,
  package manifest). Cache and lock files live under the OS cache directory by
  default; nothing is left behind in the resource path beyond explicit
  reports and backups.
