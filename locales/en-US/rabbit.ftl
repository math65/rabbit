package-reaper-description = REAPER is the digital audio workstation that everything else here builds on. RABBIT can install or update REAPER itself for you.
package-osara-description = OSARA makes REAPER usable with screen readers — NVDA, JAWS, Narrator on Windows and VoiceOver on macOS. Install it if you rely on a screen reader to use REAPER.
package-sws-description = The SWS Extension is a long-running community pack of extra actions, scripts, and helpers that polish REAPER's editing experience. Most accessible REAPER setups assume it is installed.
package-reapack-description = ReaPack is REAPER's package manager: it installs, updates, and tracks third-party scripts and extensions from inside REAPER itself. Install it if you plan to use scripts shared by the REAPER community.

package-jaws-scripts-description = The JAWS-for-REAPER scripts add script-level support for REAPER to the JAWS screen reader on Windows. RABBIT only offers them when JAWS is detected on this PC.

RABBIT installs the BtbN GPL-shared build's bin folder into UserPlugins; the patch level isn't recoverable from the DLL filenames alone, so externally-installed FFmpegs are reported with a `<major>.0.0` placeholder.
