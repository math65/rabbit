NVDA, JAWS and Narrator on Windows, VoiceOver on macOS are all widely adopted, some other Windows screen readers might also work. Install OSARA if you rely on a screen reader to use REAPER.
package-sws-description = The SWS Extension is a long-running community-authored pack of extra actions, scripts, and helpers that extend REAPER's features. For the most accessible REAPER setup, whether you're on Windows or Mac, you should install SWS alongside OSARA.
package-reapack-description = ReaPack is an open source package manager. It can be used to search, install, track and update third-party scripts and extensions from inside REAPER itself. Install this if you want to use scripts shared by the REAPER community.

package-ffmpeg-description = FFmpeg's shared runtime libraries enable REAPER's video decoder to import and play back common video and audio formats. RABBIT installs the BtbN GPL-shared build's bin folder into UserPlugins; the patch level isn't recoverable from the DLL filenames alone, so externally-installed FFmpegs are reported with a `<major>.0.0` placeholder.
